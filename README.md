# CocoaPDFCreator
With CocoaPDFCreator, you can create a paginated PDF right in a Swift Mac app. CocoaPDFCreator uses NSWebView and NSPrintOperation to convert an HTML String to a PDF, right in Swift.

CocoaPDFCreator only works on Macs; if you are looking for PDF creation for iOS, [use this code](https://gist.github.com/nyg/b8cd742250826cb1471f)
